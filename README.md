# Prof. Dr. David Buzatto ðŸ˜‰

I'm professor at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of SÃ£o Paulo, at SÃ£o JoÃ£o da Boa Vista campus, SP, Brazil. My main teaching disciplines related to data structures, compiler construction, software development, formal languages and theory of computation.

I have a Ph.D. in biotechnology (bioinformatics/computational biology) at RibeirÃ£o Preto University, SP, Brazil (2017) and a masters in Computer Science at Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, SP, Brazil (2010). My main interests are related to theory of computation and programming languages (algorithm design, data structures, compiler construction etc). I'm also interested in bioinformatics algorithms and game development.

My favorite programming languages are Java, which I have 20 years of experience with, C for teaching, JavaScript -I hate most frameworks-, C++, and Rust which I'm studying.
