### Hi there 👋

My name is David Buzatto and I'm from Brazil. Currently, and probably until I die, I'm professor at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of São Paulo, campus of São João da Boa Vista, SP, Brazil. My main teaching disciplines related to data structures, formal languages and software development.

I have a Ph.D. in biotechnology (bioinformatics/computational biology) at Ribeirão Preto University, SP, Brazil (2017) and a masters in Computer Science at Federal University of São Carlos, SP, Brazil (2010). My main interests are related to theory of computation and programming languages (algorithm design, data structures, compiler construction etc). I'm also interested in bioinformatics algorithms and game development.
