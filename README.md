### Prof. Dr. David Buzatto üòù

Currently, and probably until I die, I'm professor at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of S√£o Paulo, campus of S√£o Jo√£o da Boa Vista, SP, Brazil. My main teaching disciplines related to data structures, formal languages and software development.

I have a Ph.D. in biotechnology (bioinformatics/computational biology) at Ribeir√£o Preto University, SP, Brazil (2017) and a masters in Computer Science at Federal University of S√£o Carlos, SP, Brazil (2010). My main interests are related to theory of computation and programming languages (algorithm design, data structures, compiler construction etc). I'm also interested in bioinformatics algorithms and game development.
